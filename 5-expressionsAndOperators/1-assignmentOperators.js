//Assignment operator
let x = 20;

//addition assignment operator
x += 1; //x = x + 1

//subtraction assignment operator
x -= 1; //x = x - 1

//multiplication assignment operator
x *= 2; //x = x * 2;

//division assignment operator
x /= 2; //x = x / 4

//remainder (modulus) assignment operator
x %= 2; 

//modulus operator
console.log(5%3); //remainder of 2
console.log(25%7); //remainder of 3

//exponential assignment operator
x **=2; //x to the power of two
